;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a command `completing-history-insert-item' to
;; insert an item from history using completion. It calls
;; `completing-read' to do this, meaning it will work with your
;; preferred completion framework. The package supports: the
;; minibuffer, eshell, comint and term.

;; There is also a function `completing-history-setup-keybinding' to
;; setup a keybinding for you in all supported contexts. By default it
;; binds `completing-history-insert-item' to M-r (usually bound to a
;; command that gets the previous history item matching a regexp) and
;; unbinds the companion M-s command (usually bound to a command that
;; searches forward in the history).

;; To customize the binding of `completing-history-insert-item', use
;; `completing-history-binding'. To keep M-s from being unbound
;; customize `completing-history-unbind-M-s'.
