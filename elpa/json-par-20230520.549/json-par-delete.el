  "Delete or mark the preceding token or object/array.

ACTION is one of `delete', `mark-or-delete', or `mark', defaults to `delete'
when called from Lisp program, or the value of
`json-par-action-when-deleting-value-or-member' variable when called
interactively.

- `delete': delete the token/object/array unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the region to be deleted is marked.
  Otherwise, mark the region.
- `mark': mark the region to be deleted unconditionally.

At the beginning of the buffer, delete/mark the spaces and line breaks before
the point.

After a comma, delete/mark the previous member.

After an open bracket, action depends on
ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-INSIDE.  It is one of the following:

- `delete-outer': delete whole object/array.
- `delete-inner': delete contents of the object/array if not empty.  Delete
   whole object/array otherwise.
- `mark-outer': mark whole object/array.
- `mark-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark whole
   object/array otherwise.
- `mark-or-delete-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark
   whole object/array otherwise.  If already marked, delete it.
- `exit': move the point out of the object/array.
- `none': do nothing.

The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the value
of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-brackets-from-inside' when called
interactively.

After a close bracket, action depends on
ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-OUTSIDE.  It is one of the following:

- `delete-outer': delete whole object/array.
- `delete-inner': delete contents of the object/array if not empty.  Delete
   whole object/array otherwise.
- `mark-outer': mark whole object/array.
- `mark-or-delete-outer': mark whole object/array.  If it is already marked,
   delete it.
- `mark-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark whole
   object/array otherwise.
- `enter': move the point into the object/array.

The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the value
of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-brackets-from-outside' when called
interactively.

After a colon, action depends on ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-COLON.  It is one of the
following:

- `delete': delete whole member (key-value pair) unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the whole member is marked.  Otherwise, mark
  the whole member.
- `mark': mark whole member unconditionally.
- `skip': move the point to the opposite site.

The default value is `delete' when called from Lisp program, or the value of
variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-colon' when called interactively.

After a comma, action depends on ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-COMMA.  It is one of the
following:

- `delete': delete whole member (key-value pair) beyond the comma
  unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the whole member beyond the comma is marked.
  Otherwise, mark the whole member.
- `mark': mark whole member beyond the comma unconditionally.
- `skip': move the point to the opposite site.

The default value is `delete' when called from Lisp program, or the value of
variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-comma' when called interactively.

Otherwise, delete/mark the preceding value."

  "Delete or mark the following token or object/array.

ACTION is one of `delete', `mark-or-delete', or `mark', defaults to `delete'
when called from Lisp program, or the value of
`json-par-action-when-deleting-value-or-member' variable when called
interactively.

- `delete': delete the token/object/array unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the region to be deleted is marked.
  Otherwise, mark the region.
- `mark': mark the region to be deleted unconditionally.

At the end of the buffer, delete/mark the spaces and line breaks after the
point.

Before a comma, delete/mark the next member.

Before a close bracket, action depends on
ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-INSIDE.  It is one of the following:

- `delete-outer': delete whole object/array.
- `delete-inner': delete contents of the object/array if not empty.  Delete
   whole object/array otherwise.
- `mark-outer': mark whole object/array.
- `mark-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark whole
   object/array otherwise.
- `mark-or-delete-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark
   whole object/array otherwise.  If already marked, delete it.
- `exit': move the point out of the object/array.
- `none': do nothing.

The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the value
of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-brackets-from-inside' when called
interactively.

Before an open bracket, action depends on
ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-OUTSIDE.  It is one of the following:

- `delete-outer': delete whole object/array.
- `delete-inner': delete contents of the object/array if not empty.  Delete
   whole object/array otherwise.
- `mark-outer': mark whole object/array.
- `mark-or-delete-outer': mark whole object/array.  If it is already marked,
   delete it.
- `mark-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark whole
   object/array otherwise.
- `enter': move the point into the object/array.

The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the value
of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-brackets-from-outside' when called
interactively.

Before a colon, action depends on ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-COLON.  It is one of the
following:

- `delete': delete whole member (key-value pair) unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the whole member is marked.  Otherwise, mark
  the whole member.
- `mark': mark whole member unconditionally.
- `skip': move the point to the opposite site.

The default value is `delete' when called from Lisp program, or the value of
variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-colon' when called interactively.

Before a comma, action depends on ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-COMMA.  It is one of the
following:

- `delete': delete whole member (key-value pair) beyond the comma
  unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the whole member beyond the comma is marked.
  Otherwise, mark the whole member.
- `mark': mark whole member beyond the comma unconditionally.
- `skip': move the point to the opposite site.

The default value is `delete' when called from Lisp program, or the value of
variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-comma' when called interactively.

Otherwise, delete/mark the preceding value."

ACTION is one of `delete', `mark-or-delete', or `mark', defaults to `delete'
when called from Lisp program, or the value of
`json-par-action-when-deleting-value-or-member' variable when called
interactively.

- `delete': delete the value/member unconditionally.
- `mark-or-delete': delete only if the region to be deleted is marked.
  Otherwise, mark the region.
- `mark': mark the region to be deleted unconditionally.

At the end of an array/object, action is determinated by
ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-INSIDE.  It is one of the following:

- `delete-outer': delete whole object/array.
- `delete-inner': delete contents of the object/array if not empty.  Delete
   whole object/array otherwise.
- `mark-outer': mark whole object/array.
- `mark-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark whole
   object/array otherwise.
- `mark-or-delete-inner': mark contents of the object/array if not empty.  Mark
   whole object/array otherwise.  If already marked, delete it.
- `exit': move the point out of the object/array.

The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the value
of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-brackets-from-inside' when called
interactively."

If N is negative, delete the following characters.

- If the region is active, delete it.

- After \"extra spaces\" and HUNGRY-DELETE is non-nil, delete it.

  \"Extra spaces\" are:
  - spaces after proper indentation,
  - any spaces between a key and colon,
  - any spaces between a value and comma,
  - more than one spaces between other combination of tokens, or
  - trailing spaces at the end of a line.

- Inside spaces before indentation and HUNGRY-DELETE is non-nil, or the point is
  just after a line break, join the current line and the previous line.  See
  `json-par--join-line-backward' for details and
  ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES and

  `delete-all' when called from Lisp program, or the value of variable

  program, or the value of variable
  `json-par-action-when-joining-non-empty-lines' when called interactively.

- After other non-extra spaces or HUNGRY-DELETE is nil, delete one space.

- Just after a string, action depends on
  ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-STRING-FROM-OUTSIDE.  It is one of the following:

  - `delete-outer': delete whole string.
  - `delete-inner': delete contents of the string if not empty.  Delete whole
    string otherwise.
  - `mark-outer': mark whole string.
  - `mark-or-delete-outer': mark whole string.  If it is already marked, delete
    it.
  - `mark-inner': mark contents of the string if not empty.  Mark whole string
    otherwise.
  - `enter': move the point into the string.

  The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the
  value of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-string-from-outside' when
  called interactively.

- Just after a double quote at the beginning of a string, action
  depends on ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-STRING-FROM-INSIDE.  It is one of the
  following:

  - `delete-outer': delete whole string.
  - `delete-inner': delete contents of the string if not empty.  Delete whole
    string otherwise.
  - `mark-outer': mark whole string.
  - `mark-inner': mark contents of the string if not empty.  Mark whole string
    otherwise.
  - `mark-or-delete-inner': mark contents of the string.  Mark whole string
    otherwise.  If already marked, delete it.
  - `exit': move the point out of the string.
  - `none': do nothing.

  The default value is `delete-outer' when called from Lisp program, or the
  value of variable `json-par-action-when-deleting-string-from-inside' when
  called interactively.

- Inside a string, delete one character.

- Inside or just after a number, delete one character.

- Otherwise, delete/mark the preceding token.  See
  `json-par-delete-backward-token-or-list' for details.

  ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-INSIDE,
  ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-BRACKETS-FROM-OUTSIDE,
  ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-COLON, and
  ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-COMMA are passed to it.

The default value of HUNGRY-DELETE is t when called from Lisp program, or the
value of variable `json-par-hungry-delete' when called interactively.

  "Join the current line and the previous line.

If DELETE-FOLLOWING-SPACES is non-nil, delete the following spaces.

- If the current line is empty:
  - When ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES is `delete-all':
    Delete from point to the end of the previous non-empty line.

  - When ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES is `delete-one':
    Delete from point to the end of the previous line.

  - When ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES is `leave-one':
    Delete from point to the end of the next line of the previous non-empty
    line.  If the previous line is not empty, delete to the end of that line.

  Then, if DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES is non-nil, delete the spaces
  before the point.

  Example (`|' is the point):

  `delete-all':
    [

       |
       1
    ]
    ↓
    [|
       1
    ]

  `delete-one':
    [

       |
       1
    ]
    ↓
    [
       |
       1
    ]

  `leave-one':
    [


       |
       1
    ]
    ↓
    [
       |
       1
    ]
    ↓
    [|
       1
    ]


- If the previous line is empty:
  - When ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES is `delete-all':
    Delete from point to the beginning of the successive empty lines.

  - When ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES is `delete-one':
    Delete from point until the beginning of the previous line.

  - When ACTION-WHEN-DELETING-SUCCESSIVE-EMPTY-LINES is `leave-one':
    Delete from point to the beginning of the second line of
    the successive empty lines.  If the successive empty lines have only one
    line, delete until the beginning of that line.

  If DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES is nil, keep the spaces in the first line.

  Example (`|' is the point):

  `delete-all'
    [


       |1
    ]
    ↓
    [
       |1
    ]

  `delete-one'
    [


       |1
    ]
    ↓
    [

       |1
    ]

  `leave-one'
    [

    ]
    ↓
    [

       |1
    ]
    ↓
    [
       |1
    ]


- If the point is before the first member of array/object, or after the last
  member, convert the current array/object into one-line.  The spaces around the
  point is deleted according to DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES and
  DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES.

  Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      |1,
      2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [ |1, 2, 3 ]

    [
      1,
      2,
      3
    |]
    ↓
    [ 1, 2, 3| ]

- If the point is between members and each member is on its own line, action
  depends on ACTION-WHEN-JOINING-NON-EMPTY-LINES:

  - `just-delete': just delete the line break.

    Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      1,
    |  2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [
      1,|  2,
      3
    ]

  - `delete-line-breaks-between-members': delete all line breaks between members
    (but not before/after members).

    Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      1,
    |  2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [
      1,|  2, 3
    ]

  - `delete-line-breaks-inside-brackets': delete all line breaks inside the
    current array/object.

    Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      1,
    |  2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [ 1,|  2, 3 ]

  The spaces around the point is deleted according to DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES
  and DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES.

- Otherwise, the lines are just joined.  The spaces around the point is deleted
  according to DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES and DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES.

After the lines are joined, a space is inserted depending on the characters
around the point."

    Delete from the point to the end of the second to last line of the
    successive empty lines.  If the successive empty lines have only one line,
    delete until the end of that line.

  If DELETE-FOLLOWING-SPACES is nil, keep the spaces in the last line.

  Example (`|' is the point):

  `delete-all':
    [
       1|


    ]
    ↓
    [
       1|
    ]

  `delete-one':
    [
       1|


    ]
    ↓
    [
       1|

    ]

  `leave-one':
    [
       1|



    ]
    ↓
    [
       1|

    ]
    ↓
    [
       1|
    ]


- If the point is before the first member of array/object, or after the last
  member, convert the current array/object into one-line.  the spaces around the
  point is deleted according to DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES and
  DELETE-FOLLOWING-SPACES.

  Example (`|' is the point):

    [|
      1,
      2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [ |1, 2, 3 ]

    [
      1,
      2,
      3|
    ]
    ↓
    [ 1, 2, 3| ]

- If the point is between members and each member is on its own line, action
  depends on ACTION-WHEN-JOINING-NON-EMPTY-LINES:

  - `just-delete': just delete the line break.

    Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      1,|
      2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [
      1, |2,
      3
    ]

  - `delete-line-breaks-between-members': delete all line breaks between members
    (but not before/after members).

    Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      1,|
      2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [
      1, |2, 3
    ]

  - `delete-line-breaks-inside-brackets': delete all line breaks inside the
    current array/object.

    Example (`|' is the point):

    [
      1,|
      2,
      3
    ]
    ↓
    [ 1, |2, 3 ]

  The spaces around the point is deleted according to DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES
  and DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES.

- Otherwise, the lines are just joined.  The spaces around the point is deleted
  according to DELETE-PRECEDING-SPACES and DELETE-FOLLOWING-SPACES.

After the lines are joined, a space is inserted depending on the characters
around the point."
