Files in this directory include configuration (variables, other
settings) to be loaded only on specific machines. Two files are
loaded:

    <system-name-short>-preload.el
    <system-name-short>-postload.el

The string system-name-short is the name of the system, found as
follows: 

    (system-name-short (car (split-string system-name "\\.")))

The preload file is loaded before anything else is evaluated in the
init.el file, while the postload file is run after everything else is
evaluated in the init.el file.

The preload file is useful for loading variables needed by other
initialization functions, such as url-proxy-services which sets up
proxies if this machine is behind a firewall. The postload file can be
used for other machine-specific customizations.
